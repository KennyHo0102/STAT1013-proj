## Hypothesis

-   Tell us what your idea is and why you have chosen to pursue this
    idea.
    -   We are interested in "*Did women have a better chance of
        survival on the Titanic?*"
-   What two groups you are comparing:
    -   **G1**: survival rate of male on the Titanic; **G2**: survival
        rate of female on the Titanic
-   What you will be measuring (i.e., what your response variable will
    be)
    -   `survived`
-   Is your response variable quantitative rather than categorical?
    -   `survived` is binary data, with the order `1 > 0`, which can be
        regarded as a quantitative variable.
-   Make a prediction about what kind of difference you expect to see
    between your samples and WHY.
    -   We'd expect that **G2** \> **G1** since [Women and children
        first on the
        Titanic](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2010/mar/02/titanic-lusitania-women-children-survival).
-   Talk about how you will gather your data
    -   From Github link:
        <https://github.com/datasciencedojo/datasets/blob/master/titanic.csv>
-   If you had unlimited resources (time, money, staff, etc.) how would
    you collect your data?
    -   \(i\) Attempt to collect more data on Titanic; (ii) investigate
        if the provided dataset is a good random sampling subset of the
        original Titanic population.
